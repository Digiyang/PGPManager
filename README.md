PGPmanager is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) designed to facilitate and manage the process of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key management.

<!-- Anyone checking this out and who would be qualify to use it, will know what PGP is, so lets get straight to the point. -->
<!-- PGP is a widely-used encryption standard that allows users to secure their communication and data by encrypting messages and files with public and private keys. -->
The primary purpose of PGPmanager is to provide an intuitive and interactive interface for users to perform various PGP key operations, such as:
<!-- created a list, as this text got very long. As this is repetitive because of the feature section below, you might just take it out? -->
- generating key pairs 
- exporting and importing certificates 
- editing passwords and expiration times
- revoking keys 
- and more 

The application serves as a bridge between the user and the underlying functionality provided by the [Sequoia-OpenPGP](https://sequoia-pgp.org/) crate, a powerful library for PGP key management in Rust.

## Releases

PGPManager is currently in its *Alpha* stage. 

### Release Notes
This tool was developed as part of a bachelor thesis and my first project written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), leveraging [PGP](https://www.openpgp.org/). As such, it may have security flaws, bugs or contain boilerplate code. Reviews, critiques, and contributions are highly appreciated.

I plan to release stable versions on popular package managers like Cargo, Homebrew, and others in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the Terminal User Interface, you must first ensure that your system meets the necessary requirements.

1. Rust programming language:

The TUI is written in Rust, so Rustup, the installation and version management program for Rust, is required. If Rust is not installed on your system, please visit [the official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/). for installation instructions.

1. Sequoia OpenPGP Crate:

The TUI relies on the Sequoia OpenPGP crates for certificate management. You must have certain dependencies installed in your system. Visit [the Sequoia repository](https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia) for detailed instructions on the required libraries for different
different platforms

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Digiyang/PGPManager.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd gui
   ```

3. Build the application:
      ```bash
      cargo build --release
      ```

4. Run the application:
